But privacy is not something that you should treat as optional—it requires vigilance and protection to keep hold of it. Mozilla VPN offers you security, reliability and speed on every device, wherever you are—while supporting privacy and security and freedom online.</p>

    <h3>2. Mozilla VPN will never track you—unlike some others.</h3>
    <p>The most important thing to consider when picking either a VPN or a proxy service is choosing a trustworthy company.Be sure you understand the terms you’re agreeing to. Many claim to be great and focused on privacy, but a large number of
      them fall short on their promise. Not all proxy and VPN services are secure and private. Some will log your online
      activities so they can sell your data and information to marketing firms themselves. Other services will try to
      convince
      you to install malware on your devices.</p>
    <p>We’ve done the legwork to ensure that both the Mozilla VPN and Firefox Private Network proxy extension actually
      respect your privacy, and it’s something we’re willing to stake our reputation on. Mozilla has a reputation for building
      products that help you keep your information safe. We follow our easy-to-read, no-nonsense <a href="#">Data Privacy Principles</a> which allow us to focus only on the information we need to provide a service. And since we are backed by a mission-driven company, you can trust that the dollars you spend for this product will not only ensure you have a top-notch security, but also are making the internet better for everyone.</p>
